# SAFELOGIC — Preventive FinTech for Gig Workers

**Track:** Prevent Financial Crises Before They Happen  
*(Predict • Protect • Preserve)*

---

## 📌 Overview

**SAFELOGIC** is a **preventive fintech platform** designed for **gig workers** such as delivery partners, drivers, and freelancers.

Unlike traditional fintech systems that **react after financial distress**, SAFELOGIC uses **early financial intelligence** to **predict income instability** and trigger **ethical support before a crisis occurs**.

The platform converts **daily earnings data** into **actionable insights** for:
- Fair credit access  
- Insurance eligibility  
- Long-term financial stability  

---

## ❓ Why This Project Matters

- Gig workers **earn daily** but live with **financial instability**
- Existing fintech apps focus mainly on **loan disbursement**
- **Risk prevention and early warning** are largely ignored  

👉 SAFELOGIC shifts fintech from  
**reactive lending → preventive financial protection**

---

## 🧠 Core Innovation (AI Justification)

SAFELOGIC uses **explainable machine learning**, not black-box AI.

### Why AI is Required
- Gig income is **irregular and non-linear**
- Rule-based systems fail to detect **gradual risk patterns**
- ML models identify **early warning signals** from behavior trends

### Key AI Outputs
- **Early income drop detection**
- **30-day income stability prediction**
- **Risk classification:** `LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH`
- **Fair, behavior-based credit assessment**

---

## 🤖 AI / ML Approach (Brief)

### Input Features
- Average daily income  
- Income volatility  
- Active working days  
- Expense patterns *(if available)*  

### Models Used (Prototype)
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**

> Focus is on **interpretability over accuracy hype**

### Why Explainable AI
- Financial decisions must be **auditable**
- Judges, regulators, and users must **trust outcomes**

---

## 📊 Dataset & Data Handling

### Data Source
- **CSV-based earnings data** (simulated / anonymized)
- **Mock API integration** for gig platforms

### Why CSV First
- Enables **fast prototyping**
- Realistic for **hackathon constraints**
- Easily replaceable with **real APIs later**

### Privacy-First Design
- Explicit **user consent**
- No raw income sharing without approval
- **Hashed identifiers + audit logs** (conceptual)

## ⚙️ What Is Implemented in the Prototype

✔ Earnings ingestion via CSV  
✔ Feature extraction pipeline  
✔ Risk flagging logic (`LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH`)  
✔ Income trend visualization (demo dashboard)  
✔ Loan & insurance eligibility logic (rule + ML hybrid)  
✔ Secure backend APIs (**JWT, HTTPS**)

## 🧩 Tech Stack (Why Each Was Chosen)

- **Backend:** Python + Flask  
  → Lightweight, fast, ML-friendly  

- **ML:** pandas, scikit-learn  
  → Reliable, explainable, industry-accepted  

- **Database:** PostgreSQL  
  → ACID-compliant, suitable for financial data  

- **Frontend:** React (Dashboard)  
  → Clean UI for earnings, risk & passport  

- **Security:** TLS (HTTPS), JWT  
  → Basic fintech-grade security  

- **Payments (Demo):** Razorpay Sandbox  

---

## 🪪 Gig Financial Passport (Unique Component)

SAFELOGIC generates a **Gig Financial Passport**:
- **Verifiable income summary**
- **Shareable** with lenders or insurers
- **Independent** of any single gig platform  

👉 Creates a **portable financial identity** for gig workers.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations (Transparent Disclosure)

- Uses **simulated / anonymized data**
- Not connected to **live gig platforms**
- Models are **prototype-grade**, not production-tuned  

> These limitations are **intentional** due to hackathon constraints.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope (Round-2 / Production)

- Live API integration with gig platforms  
- Advanced **time-series income forecasting**  
- Fraud detection layer  
- Government / NGO welfare integration  
- Multi-language mobile application  

---

## 👥 Team Roles

- **FinTech & Product Lead**  
  → Financial logic, credit model, compliance framing  

- **Backend Developer**
