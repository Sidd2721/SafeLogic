# SAFELOGIC — Preventive FinTech for Gig Workers

Track: Prevent Financial Crises Before They Happen (Predict • Protect • Preserve)

Overview

SAFELOGIC is a preventive fintech platform designed for gig workers (delivery partners, drivers, freelancers).
Unlike traditional fintech systems that react after financial distress, SAFELOGIC uses early financial intelligence to predict income instability and trigger ethical support before a crisis occurs.

The platform converts daily earnings data into actionable insights for fair credit, insurance eligibility, and financial stability.
